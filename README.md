# DataDrill
<p>Note - This app was created to work on specific reports with some proprietary information. Some code and all data has been replaced with dummy information in this repository.</p>

<p>The purpose of this app is to pre-filter reports to show only line items which relate to the user's location. Then, the user is able to drill down into each line item to find where that equipment is used across all locations.</p>

<b> Using the App </b>

  <li>Select which subset of information to view from combo box (A through C).</li>
  <li>Click GO!</li>
  <li>Right clicking any "item" in item column will find all equipment which uses that item site-wide.<br>
  <li>Right-clicking in this generated equipment list will allow for export to .csv</li>
