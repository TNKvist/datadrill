# DataDrill
<p>Note - This app was created to work on specific reports with particularly defined data. Some code and all data has been replaced with dummy information in this repository.</p>

<h3>DataDrill is a lightweight application which was built to filter and drill down into data which was being generated from an automated report. The report was missing critical information to make actionable decisions, so DataDrill fills in this information based on the user's request.</h3>

This application is built around relating part numbers to the equipment they are used in and the locations the equipment reside.
