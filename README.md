# DataDrill

DataDrill is a lightweight application which was built to filter and drill down into data which was being generated from an automated report. The report was missing critical information to make actionable decisions, so DataDrill fills in this information based on the user's request.

This application is built around relating part numbers to the equipment they are used in and the locations the equipment reside.

<b> Using the App </b>
  1) Select the report
  2) Select your location
      3) Right clicking any part number will bring up which equipment the part is used
      4) Right click again to export the table as .csv.
